# NN_Implementer

NN_implementer is Neural Network modeler and user interface coded from scratch.

### COMPONENTS:

#### NN_model_implementation.py: 
Interface to accept user's data and train custom Neural Networks.

#### NN_with_gradient_descent.py: 
Implements Gradient Descent training and testing. Accepts user inputs of layer sizes, depth and activation functions.

#### NN_activation_functions.py: 
Common loss, activation and regularization functions and their derivatives. Functions defined here automatically integrate and appear as an options for the Gradient Descent algorithm.

#### NN_data_load_and_shape.py: 
helper functions to accept training data and format it as needed by our GD algorithm
